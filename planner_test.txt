This project is a personal scheduling system intended to keep track of
a single person's schedule and activities. The system will store and
display two kinds of schedule information: activities and statuses.
Activities and statuses both support a protocol which allows them to
be checked for overlap with another object supporting the protocol.
>>> from planner.data import Activity, Status
>>> from datetime import datetime

Activities and statuses are stored in schedules, to which they can be
added and removed.
>>> from planner.data import Schedule
>>> activity = Activity('test activity',
..      datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
..      hour = 10, minute = 15),
..      datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
..      hour = 12, minute = 30))
>>> duplicate_activity = Activity('test activity',
..      datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
..      hour = 10, minute = 15),
..      datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
..      hour = 12, minute = 30))
>>> status = Status('test status',
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 7, day = 1,
...     hour = 10, minute = 15),
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 7, day = 1,
...     hour = 12, minute = 30))
>>> schedule = Schedule()
>>> schedule.add(activity)
>>> schedule.add(status)
>>> status in schedule
True
>>> activity in schedule
True
>>> duplicate_activity in schedule
True
>>> schedule.remove(activity)
>>> schedule.remove(status)
>>> status in schedule
False
>>> activity in schedule
False

Activities represent tasks that the person must actively engage in,
and they are therefore mutually exclusive: no person can have two
activities that overlap the same period of time.
>>> activity1 = Activity('test activity 1',
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 9, minute = 5),
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 12, minute = 30))
>>> activity2 = Activity('test activity 2',
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 10, minute = 15),
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 13, minute = 30))
>>> schedule = Schedule()
>>> schedule.add(activity1)
>>> schedule.add(activity2)
Traceback (most recent call last):
ScheduleError: "test activity 2" overlaps with "test activity 1"

Statuses represent tasks that a person engages in passively, and so
can overlap with each other and with activities.
>>> activity1 = Activity('test activity 1',
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 9, minute = 5),
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 12, minute = 30))
>>> status1 = Status('test status 1',
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 10, minute = 15),
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 13, minute = 30))
>>> status2 = Status('test status 2',
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 8, minute = 45),
...     datetime(year = 2014, month = 6, day = 1,
...     hour = 15, minute = 30))
>>> schedule = Schedule()
>>> schedule.add(activity1)
>>> schedule.add(status1)
>>> schedule.add(status2)
>>> activity1 in schedule
True
>>> status1 in schedule
True
>>> status2 in schedule
True

Schedules can be saved to a sqlite database, and they can be reloaded
from that stored state.
>>> from planner.persistence import file
>>> storage = File(':memory:')
>>> schedule.store(storage)
>>> newsched = Schedule.load(storage)
>>> schedule == newsched
True
